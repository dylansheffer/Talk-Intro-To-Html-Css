## Essential HTML Concepts

---

### HTML Tags

```html
<p></p>
```

- The tag name is wrapped between ankle brackets (<>)
- There's a beginning (<>) and an ending tag (</>)
- You generally put your stuff between the tags

```html
<p>💪💪💪</p>
```

---

### Structure of an HTML Document

- `<html>` tag wraps the document
- `<head>` contains information about the page
  - The title of the page, associated documents, etc
- `<body>` contains the page's content

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>HTML Document Demo</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello Everybody 👋</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Inline vs Block Elements

---

class: middle

#### Block Elements

Creates a new line on its container.

*It blocks others from sitting next to it.*

```html
<h1>Heading 1</h1>
<p>Paragraph</p>
```
<h1>Heading 1</h1>
<p>Paragraph</p>

---

class: middle

#### Inline Elements

Does not create a new line.

*It will sit inline with other elements.*

```html
<p>Paragraph with an <span style="color: red;">Inline Element</span>.</p>
```
<p>Paragraph with an <span style="color: red;">Inline Element</span>.</p>

### IDs, Classes, Attributes!

**IDs:** Are used to uniquely identify something on a page. Used for CSS and javascript selections and to link directly to a section of a page.

```html
<main id="main-content"></main>
```

**Classes:** Are used to assign an element to a class name. Used for applying CSS Styles, and selecting elements in javascript.
*Note:* Many styles can be applied to a single HTML element.

```html
<p class="big-text">This text is big</p>
<p class="big-text red-text">This text is big and red</p>
```

**Attributes:** Other things that are sometimes put into HTML tags. Used to give additional information to a tag.
*Examples:* The source of an image on an image tag or the destination of a link.

```html
<img src="https://gph.to/2ReDxOs" alt="Squidward Dabbing">
```

<img style="width: 10%;" src="https://gph.to/2ReDxOs" alt="Squidward Dabbing">

### Tag purposes

- Add content on a page like images, paragraphs, headings, etc.
- Generic containers used to simply group content together (generally for positioning and layout).
- Landmark elements which are tags that are used to annotate a document with keys on where to find certain types of information like the main content, different sections, or the navigation.

## Essential CSS Concepts


---

### Syntax

CSS has 3 parts to its syntax (code grammar)

1. The selector
2. Curly braces
3. CSS properties

```css
div {
  font-size: 18px;
}
```

**Note:** Each property ends with a semi-colon `;`

---

### Selectors

Selectors can be simple to very complicated.

The most simple type of selection is just a tag selector. This is where you just give it a tag name.

```css
h1 {
  color: red;
}
```

You can also select by class or id which you define in the HTML.

Classes selected by using a `.` followed by the class' name.

```css
.active {
  text-decoration: underline;
}
```

IDs are selected by using a `#` followed by the ID's name.

```css
#maincontent {
  background-color: white;
}
```

---

### Selectors (cont.)

You may also use more than one selector that are separated by commas to apply the same style to multiple things.

```css
h1, h2 {
  color: aqua;
}
```

Finally you can target specific relationships using CSS selectors by first giving the selector the outer element followed by the inner element.

```css
ul li {
  text-decoration: none;
}
```

---

### The Cascade

CSS stands for cascading style sheets.

The cascade part is the concept that the later selectors in the document are the styles applied to the HTML elements.

```css
p {
  color: #BADA55
}

/* ... other code */

p {
  /* This style is applied instead of the original color */
  color: goldenrod;
}
```

<p style="color: goldenrod">Text is goldenrod because it came last!</p>

---

### Specificity

The other rule for determining what style will be applied to an element is specificity.

Specificity means the more specific the selector is selected over a less specific tag.

#### Scale of specificity (low to high)

1. General tags (main, p, body)
2. Classes
3. IDs

---

### Specificity (cont.)

Each type of selector in the CSS declaration adds a certain amount of points to its specificity score.

*General* gives 1 point, *Classes* give 10, *IDs* give 100.

`main{}` is less specific than `.container{}`

`.container{}` is less specific than `#maincontent{}`
